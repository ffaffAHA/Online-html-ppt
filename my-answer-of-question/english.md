## Hobbies

One of my hobbies is reading classic books.

My favorite is Dubliners by James Joyce. 
 
I love how it shows people feeling "stuck" in life,
  
both personally and as a society.
  
For example,

in the story **The Dead**,
  
snow symbolizes how life and death are connected. 

Joyceâ€™s writing makes me think deeply about human emotions and cultural problems.

Studying this book improved my skills.

I now notice small details, like how dialogue hides true feelings.

This helps me in my studies because I want to research how stories reflect societyâ€™s struggles.
  
Reading isnâ€™t just fun for meâ€”itâ€™s training for my future work in literature.

## Why This Works:

Simple Language: Uses basic vocabulary (e.g., "stuck," "small details").

Short Examples: Focuses on one story (The Dead) and one symbol (snow).

Clear Skills Link: Connects reading to academic goals without jargon.

Time-Friendly: ~150 wordsâ€”easy to deliver in 2 minutes, even with pauses.

Practice reading this aloud slowly. Focus on key words: "stuck," "snow," "skills," "future work." Youâ€™ll sound confident! ðŸ˜Š
