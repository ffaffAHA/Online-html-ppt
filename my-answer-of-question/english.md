# Answer (Simplified for 2 Minutes):

## Hobbies

One of my hobbies is reading classic books.

My favorite is Dubliners by James Joyce. 
 
I love how it shows people feeling "stuck" in life,
  
both personally and as a society.
  
For example,

in the story **The Dead**,
  
snow symbolizes how life and death are connected. 

Joyce’s writing makes me think deeply about human emotions and cultural problems.

Studying this book improved my skills.

I now notice small details, like how dialogue hides true feelings.

This helps me in my studies because I want to research how stories reflect society’s struggles.
  
Reading isn’t just fun for me—it’s training for my future work in literature.

### Why This Works:

Simple Language: Uses basic vocabulary (e.g., "stuck," "small details").

Short Examples: Focuses on one story (The Dead) and one symbol (snow).

Clear Skills Link: Connects reading to academic goals without jargon.

Time-Friendly: ~150 words—easy to deliver in 2 minutes, even with pauses.

Practice reading this aloud slowly. Focus on key words: "stuck," "snow," "skills," "future work." You’ll sound confident! 😊

**the influence of process parameters (scanning speed, laser power and scanning distance) on the temperature field of TC4 alloy melted by laser selective zone melting**

The purpose of this work is to study "the influence of process parameters (scanning speed, laser power and scanning distance) on the temperature field of TC4 alloy melted by laser selective zone melting”.

In this paper, numerical simulation of the selective laser melting and forming process is carried out to study the distribution law of the temperature field, and the results of the research will be useful for selecting the appropriate process parameters and reducing the temperature gradient, which will in turn reduce the number of experiments and improve the success rate of the experiments.

## intrudec the SLM

**修正版：**
Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an advanced rapid prototyping technology. It uses metal powder to create strong metal parts, similar to Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) but with higher density.

SLM can achieve nearly 100% density using standard metal powders. However, its high-energy laser beam melts powder too quickly. This rapid melting causes large temperature changes, leading to defects like cracks and residual stress.

Therefore, simulating the temperature field in SLM is critical. Using ANSYS software, we control the laser's movement and study how scanning speed affects heat distribution.

Key findings:

1. Longer exposure increases molten pool temperature and heat-affected zone (HAZ)
2. Highest temperature gradients occur at the laser's front
3. Slower scanning speeds improve part density

In conclusion, controlling heat accumulation and scanning speed can enhance SLM quality. Future research should focus on optimizing these parameters.

以下是针对优化后文本的逐句背诵训练法，采用「分块记忆+联想定位」的科学记忆策略：

---

**Step 1 - 分块染色记忆**
将段落按逻辑染成3种颜色记忆：

```
+ 基础概念（红色）：

- Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an advanced rapid prototyping technology.
- It uses metal powder to create strong metal parts, similar to SLS but with higher density.

! 核心问题（蓝色）：

- SLM can achieve nearly 100% density using standard powders.
- However, its high-energy laser melts powder too quickly.
- This causes large temperature changes, leading to cracks and residual stress.

? 解决方案（绿色）：

- Simulating the temperature field is critical.
- Using ANSYS, we control laser movement and study scanning speed effects.

```


**记忆技巧**：

- 用红→蓝→绿的顺序建立「定义→问题→对策」的逻辑链
- 每颜色块控制在3句内，符合工作记忆容量

---

**Step 2 - 关键词提取法**
为每句提取2个核心词，建立记忆锚点：

1. **SLM** ←→ **advanced prototyping**
2. **metal powder** ←→ **higher density**
3. **100% density** ←→ **standard powders**
4. **high-energy** ←→ **melts quickly**
5. **temperature changes** ←→ **cracks/stress**
6. **simulating** ←→ **critical**
7. **ANSYS** ←→ **control movement**
8. **scanning speed** ←→ **study effects**

**联想训练**：

- 将关键词对转化为视觉图像（如"high-energy"想象激光爆炸图标）
- 用手机录制自己快速朗读关键词对，利用碎片时间盲听

---

**Step 3 - 逻辑串联法**
用连接词构建记忆网络：
```
[虽然] SLM是先进技术 [而且] 能达到高密度，
[但是] 激光能量过高 [导致] 温度剧变，
[因此] 必须模拟温度场 [通过] ANSYS控制，
[特别要] 研究扫描速度的影响。
```

**进阶技巧**：

- 用手势强化逻辑词（"虽然"←左手下压，"但是"←右手上抬）
- 制作思维导图，用箭头连接因果关系

## past 

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology, based on Selective Laser Sintering
(SLS), can produce strong metallic models directly from metal powders, and it is the newest development of rapid prototyping. 

The part can be made it possible to produce nearly 100% dense from customary metal powder. 

However, the laser bean has high energy density and speedy speed. 

The powder changes from solid state to liquid state or from liquid state to solid state in so short time that temperature gradient is very large, which easily leads to bring forth many defects, such as, remain stress, cracks. 

Therefore, it is significative to simulate distribution of the temperature field in Selective Laser Melting.

By using the ANSYS parameter design language (APDL), the moving of laser beam can be controlled. 

This article simulates distribution of the temperature field in selective laser melting, especially, the influence of scaning speed to temperature field.

The simulation results show that with the time increasing, the temperature of the molten pool becomes higher and HAZ becomes bigger because of the heat accumulative effect; great temperature gradients exist in the front of laser spot; the relative low speed is be propitious to increase the density of SLM part.

At the end of thesis, the summary of thesis is made, and some suggestions to improve SLM part performance are prospective proposed.

Key words: Selective Laser Melting; Simulation; ANSYS; Temperature field; Stress field; Density
